A Power BI Dashboard for the DataViz 2025 Challenge, organised by Macquarie University.

A little preview of the dashboard 😊

## 👋 About the Project

This dashboard was created as part of a group entry inspired by the UN Datathon theme: Energy Access & Affordability (SDG 7).

While our team aligned on the overall structure, I independently designed and developed the full Electricity Access page from the initial concept and page layout to the data modelling, visuals, and insights.

## 🔎 What This Page Highlights

Global progress in electricity access over the past two decades

Regions still facing major gaps, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa

How energy affordability remains a challenge for low-income nations

Clear visual insights into where improvement is most urgently needed

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this dashboard is to make the global energy divide easy to see and understand, helping highlight the inequalities that must be addressed to achieve SDG 7.
